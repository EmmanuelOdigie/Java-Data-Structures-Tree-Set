# Java-Data-Structures-Tree-Set
Tree Set, works like 'collection.sort()' 
but without using collection class, this will automatically organises the
elements through the imported class Tree Set, instead of importing two classes Tree Set & Collections class, you just 
import one, it uses object created '.add' = object.add("House,"Car); once you have a few set up, it'll then organise 
the elements
